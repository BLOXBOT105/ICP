-> Defines the main function AKA the entry point
int main() {
    int winLength = 1920;
    int winHeight = 1080;

    --> Create Window Method is Imported from the 'iUi' Library. We then pass it the the 2 variables we made above and a method return value which will then create a window for us <--

    CreateWindow(GetWindowName(), winLength, winHeight);
}

string GetWindowName() {
    ret "Test ICP File";
}
